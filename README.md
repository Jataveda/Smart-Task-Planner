# Smart-Task-Planner

An AI-powered task planning application that breaks down user goals into actionable tasks with intelligent timelines, dependencies, and priority management.
 
 Project Overview
Smart Task Planner uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user goals and generate comprehensive project plans with:
- Intelligent task breakdown
- Dependency management
- Timeline calculation
- Priority assignment
- Phase categorization

## Features

- **AI-Powered Planning**: Uses LLM reasoning to intelligently break down goals
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatically calculates task dependencies and sequences
- **Timeline Generation**: Smart date calculation based on task duration and dependencies
- **Priority Management**: Assigns priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- **Multiple Templates**: Pre-configured templates for common goal types (product launch, learning, events)
- **Export Functionality**: Download plans as JSON for external use
- **Plan Management**: Save, load, and delete multiple plans
- **RESTful API**: Complete backend API for integration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+ (for frontend development)
- OpenAI API key (or any LLM provider)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-task-planner.git
cd smart-task-planner
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

5. Run the backend:
```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

The React frontend is a standalone component that can be:
1. Integrated into your existing React application
2. Used directly in the browser (artifact version)
3. Built as a standalone app

      "end_date": "2025-10-17",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "Generated plan analysis",
  "created_at": "2025-10-15T10:30:00",
  "summary": "Plan created with 8 tasks spanning 14 days"
}
```

### 3. Get All Plans
```
GET /api/plans
```

### 4. Get Specific Plan
```
GET /api/plans/{plan_id}
```

### 5. Update Task Status
```
PATCH /api/plans/{plan_id}/tasks/{task_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

### 6. Delete Plan
```
DELETE /api/plans/{plan_id}
```

##  LLM Integration

### Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to generate high-quality task breakdowns:

```
You are a professional project planner. Break down the following goal into actionable tasks with:
1. Task name and detailed description
2. Estimated duration in days
3. Dependencies (which tasks must be completed first)
4. Priority level (critical, high, medium, low)
5. Phase/category

Goal: {user_goal}

Respond in JSON format...
```

### LLM Provider Support

The system supports multiple LLM providers:
- **OpenAI GPT-4** (default)
- **Anthropic Claude**
- **Google PaLM**
- **Local models** (LLaMA, Mistral)

To switch providers, modify the `generate_task_breakdown_with_llm()` function in `app.py`.

### Fallback System

If LLM is unavailable, the system uses intelligent rule-based generation:
- Pattern matching for common goal types
- Template-based task generation
- Smart duration calculation
- Dependency inference

## Security Considerations

- API key environment variables
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting (recommended for production)
- CORS configuration
- SQL injection prevention (when using database)

## Production Deployment

### Database Setup
Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL/MongoDB:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/taskplanner'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export SECRET_KEY=...
```

### Deployment Options
- **Heroku:** `git push heroku main`
- **AWS:** Use Elastic Beanstalk or EC2
